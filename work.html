    In June and July of 2012, a group of 20 Teach4Moroccco and Interface volunteers
    traveled to a village in the High Atlas Mountains, Ichbaken. There, Teach4Morocco
    reconstructed the elementary school, built a wall around the school, built
    clean new bathrooms, connected the school to electricity and water, repaired
    broken windows, insulated the roofs, made and installed new metallic doors
    for the school, classrooms, and bathroom, painted the doors and windows,
    provided heaters, installed new blackboards and curtains, leveled the floors,
    employed 60 locals in these building processes, and drew support from dozens
    of volunteers.
