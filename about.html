                    <p>Teach4Morocco's mission is to promote education and provide a pleasant environment for students and teachers alike in schools in the High Atlas Mountains.</p>
                    <h1>Vision</h1>
                    <p>The vision of Teach4Morocco is to achieve a high rate of literacy in the High-Atlas region and reduce the school dropout rate. Teach4Morocco's objectives are to overcome the barriers of education of the children and facilitate the process of learning.<br/>
                    This vision is formulated in four primary goals which are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Increase awareness of the importance of education as a way of sustainable development for the region. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make schools a better and pleasant environment for students to like.
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Improve and maintain the condition of the existing facilities and provide new ones.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Provide the necessary supplies and school materials for students and schools.
                       </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> </p>
                    <h1>Our focus</h1>
                    <p>The primary focus of Teach4Morocco is to improve the education process of the children and the environment in which they study. Teach4Morocco intends to evaluate the environment of schooling first then determine the needs of the schools. Once this step is done, Teach4Morocco will be working on the best strategies to overcome those barriers and improve the learning conditions of the students and the teaching conditions of the teachers.</p>
