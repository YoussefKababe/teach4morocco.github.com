    About us:

</br>
<p>
    Teach4Morocco is a Moroccan national Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)
    created in 2011 and based in Meknes.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Teach4Morocco is made of a team of young people concerned about the state
    of education in Morocco. They belong to different Moroccan institutions
    of higher education and share a desire to affect lasting change. Our team
    is also made of education practitioners with years of experience in the
    field of education in Morocco.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    We believe that while improving the system of education can involve big
    governmental strategies, it also necessitates small interventions. We also
    believe that change comes from within and we want to be part of the solution.
    Teach4Morocco advocates a ground up approach whereby Moroccans take an
    active role in improving the current educational system.
